#### Example Flair Enforcement Message

Hey there, u/USERNAME,
    
Thanks for your submission to r/SUBREDDIT! This is a friendly reminder that the moderators of this community have asked for all posts in r/SUBREDDIT to have a *post flair* - in other words, a relevant tag or category. 
    
**Here's how to select a flair for your submission**:

**The following post flairs are available on r/SUBREDDIT**:
    
    
* Flair 1
* Flair 2
* ...
        
     
Post flairs help keep r/SUBREDDIT organized and allow our subscribers to easily sort through the posts they want to see. Please contact the mods of r/SUBREDDIT if you have any questions. Thank you very much!

* The following line is also included if `strict` flair enforcement is on:

*Your post has been removed but will be automatically restored if you select a flair for it within 24 hours. We apologize for the inconvenience.*

## FAQ

#### What kind of subreddits benefit from using Artemis?

The subreddits that benefit most from Artemis are those that have a comprehensive post flair system. Subreddits with no post flairs will obviously not benefit from flair enforcing.

Subreddits that use their post flairs dynamically, like r/translator or r/excel, will likely benefit less from Artemis since an individual post's flair is automatically assigned and constantly changing.

#### When does Artemis update the statistics wiki pages?

Artemis begins to update statistics wiki pages for its monitored subreddits (`r/SUBREDDIT/wiki/assistantbot_statistics`) at midnight UTC.

#### Who can use Artemis?

Any subreddit can! Just invite u/AssistantBOT as a moderator with at least the `wiki` permission.

#### Our subreddit wiki is public - why does Artemis need the `wiki` permission? Can't it run with no mod permissions?

Artemis needs the `wiki` mod permission for a couple of reasons:

1. So that it can create a new wiki page if a subreddit has disabled its wiki.
2. So that it can set the statistics wikipage to be only viewable by mods.

#### How do I disable Artemis?

Just remove it as a moderator from your subreddit. 

#### Why can't statistics gathering be turned off?

Gathering statistics helps moderators understand the activity and health of their community. All of the data for statistics (with the exception of traffic) is publicly obtainable, and it is our firm belief that all moderators can benefit from being able to view the statistics that Artemis provides.

#### Who made Artemis?

I'm u/kungming2, and I also wrote and maintain Wenyuan and Ziwen (u/translator-BOT) and u/LEGO_IDEAS_BOT, among others.

#### Why is this bot called Artemis?

Honestly, it's just because I like the name. But perhaps one can think of this bot as [hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis) down both unflaired posts and statistics.

#### I have a feature suggestion for Artemis.

Feel free to shoot me a message at u/kungming2.

#### Where can I find the source code?

You can find Artemis's source code at [this repo on Github](https://github.com/kungming2/AssistantBOT).
